### Enigma - zero-knowledge finance tracker

Enigma is a finance tracker built with a strong focus on privacy, and data ownership.

The core principle of this project is zero-knowledge architecture:
the server never sees, never stores, and can never reconstruct users’ financial data.

Core Principles
1. Zero-Knowledge by design
All data is encrypted on the client.
The server stores only encrypted data.
Encryption keys are derived from the user’s password and never leave the browser.
The server cannot read, analyze, or infer transaction data.
Even the project maintainer cannot access user finances.

2. No Personally Identifiable Information
No email addresses.
No usernames tied to real identities.
No names, phone numbers, or recovery emails.
